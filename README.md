# Read-Excel-Tables-with-.NET-and-OpenXML

WIP - currently uses hard-coded reference to Excel file ("E:\ExcelTestFile.xlsx")

This is my first look into using OpenXML to work with Excel files in a .NET console app.

At present this takes a document with one worksheet, which has one table, and prints all the values of that table.

First attempts, happy that there's a solid outcome, want to write up more about how this works as it's great when it works but hugely counter-intuitive to me personally!

Hope it helps!
